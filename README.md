# The Donations Dilemma
An Analog Spin on the Prisoner's Dilemma.
By Fiona Shyne and Logan Walker

Evolutionary Computation at Union College - 2021

In this project, we explore a new approach to the well-explored Prisoner's Dilemma.
Taking inspiration from the video game series "Jackbox", we used the donations
minigame from Murder Trivia Party 2 within Jackbox Party Pack 6 as the main
source to represent and portray our analog interpretation.

The goal of this project is to determine whether or not there is a
strategy within this 'Donations Dilemma' that proves to be more superior
than random choice. To accomplish this goal, a variety of different experiments
and comparisons have been devised. Utilizing human designed strategies as well
as a baseline agent of random choice, agents are created and evolved using a GP
package, Deap. With fitness and trends acquired and visualized, we can make
comparisons between the general success of evolved agents versus those
belonging to randomness or human design.


## Preemptive Requirements (For Windows, should be similar for Linex?)

### Download Deap package

To install the Deap package, open the command prompt and run:

```
pip install deap
```

### Download networkx package

With the command prompt already open
Install the networkx package by running:

```
pip install networkx
```

### Download matplotlib package

Install the matplotlib package by running:

```
pip install matplotlib
```

## How to start/run the experiments
pfft idk, run GA.py or something

## Where are the generated graphs located?
pfft idk, ask Fiona or something

TODO:
- write and run experiments for tournaments of two player rounds
- determine how to represent the player in which agents are donating to for three player games
- experiment analysis
- Fix up the subsections of README.md *AHEM, LOGAN*
